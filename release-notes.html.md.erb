**Release Date:** XXXX XX, 2019

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This release is incompatible with previous
  releases of <%= vars.product_short %>. This is because <%= vars.product_short %> v0.X.XX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
  It is recommended to delete the service instances and the Tile from previous releases of <%= vars.product_short %>
  before installing <%= vars.product_short %> v0.X.XX. You must add your offerings again.
  To do this, do the procedures in
  <a href="./using.html#add">Add a Service Offering to <%= vars.product_short %> </a>
   and <a href="./using.html#enable">Enable Service Offering Access</a>.
  </p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* The KSM CLI replaces the Bazaar CLI.
* Binding credentials are automatically stored in Credhub.
This requires <%= vars.product_short %> to be installed on a <%= vars.pas_short %> deployment
with CredHub enabled. For instructions about enabling CredHub,
see [Securing Services Instance Credentials with Runtime CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/opsguide/secure-si-creds.html).
* Platform operators can offer services that have multiple Helm charts.
For more information, see [(Optional) Offer Multiple Charts in a Single Offering](#multiple-charts).


### Known Issues

Upgrading from previous versions of KSM Tile will leave orphaned service instances and service broker.
It is recommended to delete the service instances and the Tile from previous releases of <%= vars.product_short %>
before installing <%= vars.product_short %> v0.X.XX, instead of upgrading the Tile.
