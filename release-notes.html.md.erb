**Release Date:** XXXX XX, 2019

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> This release is incompatible with the v0.4
  beta release of <%= vars.product_short %>.
  Before you install <%= vars.product_short %> v0.5, you must uninstall
  <%= vars.product_short %> v0.4 from Ops Manager. After you install <%= vars.product_short %> v0.5,
  you must re-add your service offerings.

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Platform operators can offer services that have multiple Helm charts.
For more information, see [(Optional) Offer Multiple Charts in a Single Offering](./prepare-offer.html#multiple-charts).
* The KSM CLI replaces the Bazaar CLI.
* Binding credentials are automatically stored in runtime CredHub.
This requires <%= vars.product_short %> to be installed on a <%= vars.pas_short %> deployment
with CredHub enabled. For instructions about enabling CredHub,
see [Securing Services Instance Credentials with Runtime CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/opsguide/secure-si-creds.html).
