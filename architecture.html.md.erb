This topic describes <%= vars.product_full %> components, architecture, and technical detail.

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.product_short %> is a collection of components running on a BOSH deployed VM that communicates with both Kubernetes clusters and <%= vars.product_name %>.

<%# Should we be using "Pivotal Platform" or "Pivotal Cloud Foundry" in the above sentence? %>

The following diagram describes how <%= vars.product_short %> communicates with <%= vars.product_name %> and a Kubernetes cluster:

</a>

<%# The above diagram should probably be simplified or split up. It is hard to follow and read since the text is small. We also should write more text below that explains or describes the diagram in more detail for clarity/accessibility reasons. %>

<%= vars.product_short %> has the the following components:

+ [KSM Daemon](#ksm-d)
+ [KSM Broker](#ksm-broker)
+ [SOME OTHER COMPONENT?]()

##<a id='ksm-d'></a> KSM Daemon

The KSM daemon (ksm-d) is the API that the KSM CLI communicates with. When an operator saves a Helm chart,
the ksm-d component validates the chart and stores it in ChartMuseum. If you provide a descriptor in your `ksm.yaml` file, the component stores the 
the description as well. 

For more information about Helm charts and the `ksm.yaml` file, see [Using KSM](./using.html).

##<a id='ksm-broker'></a> KSM Broker

The KSM broker is an Open Service Broker. When a <%= vars.product_name %> developer runs `cf create-service`, the Cloud Controller sends that request to the broker. The broker then deploys
the Helm chart needed for the service.

 For more information about Open Service Broker, see [Open Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/).

##<a id='osbapi'></a> Detailed life-cycle
###<a id='provision'></a> Provision
When a service instance is provisioned, <%= vars.product_short %>  creates a namespace in the cluster. This namespace is named `kibosh-xxxx`, where `xxxx` is the
`instance_id` generated by <%= vars.product_name %>.
