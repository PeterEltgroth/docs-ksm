This topic provides operators with basic instructions for troubleshooting
Kubernetes Service ManagerÂ (KSM) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id='issue-debugging'></a> Advanced Debugging
Advanced debugging might require using the `helm` and `kubectl` CLIs.

* [Tiller](https://docs.helm.sh/glossary/#tiller) is the server side component of Helm.
Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF installs Tiller into a specific namespace, `kibosh`.
To manually run Helm commands, log in to the Kubernetes
cluster and include the namespace flag to talk the
Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF's Helm `--tiller-namespace=kibosh`.

##<a id='issue-cleanup'></a> Cleanup
Pivotal Cloud Foundry gives an asynchronously provisioned service seven days to become healthy. It
sometimes requires manual cleanup to remove services earlier in some failure modes.
[Purging a service instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html#purge-a-service-instance)
will remove the service from Pivotal Cloud Foundry. This might, however, leave resources in the backing cluster.

To fully clean up, delete the Helm release and the namespace, if either is still present.
Both the cluster and the Helm resources are named after the service's GUID.

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
helm delete namespace kibosh-GUID
kubectl delete namespace kibosh-GUID
```
