Kubernetes Service Manager for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) enables the platform operator
to provide app developers with access to services running on
[Pivotal Container Service (PKS)](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service)
through the
[Cloud Foundry Marketplaces](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/index.html)
for consumption by Pivotal Application Services (PAS) apps.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

PKS service integrations can take a lot of forms.
Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF tackles three large classes of services:

* Installing a single Helm chart to a particular cluster (`shared-instance`).
* Provisioning services as needed by individual teams
  from the [Cloud Foundry Marketplaces](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/index.html)
  (`dedicated-instances`).
* Installing a cluster add-on, such as an observability or security tool.

In the shared-instance and add-on cases, Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF helps
by providing a consistent operator experience for installing a Helm chart
into a particular cluster.

In the dedicated-instances case, Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF lets the operator offer an Independent Software Vendor (ISV)
or open source Helm chart to
[Pivotal Application Service (PAS)](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-application-service)
developers on demand.
Developers who use the `cf create-service` command will, in realtime, provision a chart
to the service's backing cluster.


## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF includes the following key features:

* A broker tile that provisions dedicated service instances into a PKS cluster.
* A CLI for managing broker dedicated-instance offerings
  and installing a shared-instance into a cluster.
