This topic describes how to install and configure Kubernetes Service Manager for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='install'></a> Install Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF

To install the Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, do the following:

1. Login and download the **Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF** product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. Navigate to your Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under **Import a Product**, click **+** next to the version number of Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF** tile to open its configuration panes.

## <a id="configure"></a>Configure the Tile
Follow the steps below to configure Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF service.


###<a id='az-networks'></a> Configure AZs and Networks

Follow the steps below to select an availability zone (AZ) to run the service broker and to select networks.

 1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**

 1. Configure the fields as follows:
   <table>
     <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
     <tr>
        <td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ that you want the singleton VMs to run in.
            This selection does not affect the Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select additional AZs.
            This selection controls the regions in which Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF is deployed.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select the same network that is used for the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) component VMs. (To see which network is used, navigate to **PCF Ops Manager** > **Pivotal Application Service (PAS)** > **Assign AZs and Networks**.) </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you change the network or its IP address
       after they are assigned your deployment fails. For more information,
       see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/changing-ips.html">Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment</a>.</p>

 2. Click **Save**.


### <a id="kubeconfig"></a> Configure Cluster Credentials

To use the Pivotal Container Service Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) to configure default settings for your kubeconfig, do the following:

1. Retrieve your cluster credentials with the PKS CLI,
   folowing the procedure in [Retrieve Cluster Credentials](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/cluster-credentials.html#get-credentials).

1. Navigate to `$HOME/.kube/config` and record the following values for your cluster:
  + `certificate-authority-data`. This value is the CA certificate for the PKS cluster.
  + `server`. This values includes both the Kubernetes API endpoint and endpoint port in the format `<endpoint>:<port>`.
  + `token`. This value is found in the `context:user` section.

1. Navigate to **PCF Ops Manager** > **Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF** > **Kubernetes Configuration**.

1. Configure the fields as follows:

<table class="nice">
  <tr>
  <th>Field</th>
  <th>Instructions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>A base64 encoded PEM Cluster CA certificate</strong></td>
    <td>Enter the value of <code>certificate-authority-data</code> in your kubeconfig.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>K8s API endpoint</strong></td>
    <td>Enter the endpoint value of <code>server</code> in your kubeconfig. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>K8s API endpoint port</strong></td>
    <td>Enter the port value of <code>server</code> in your kubeconfig.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Token</strong></td>
    <td>Enter the value of <code>token</code> in your kubeconfig. </td>
  </tr>
  </table>

### <a id="container"></a> Configure Container Registry

When you configure a private registry,
Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF changes the helm chart to point to images in the private registry.
Pivotal recommends using a private registry in production.
You obtain these values from your container registry, such as Harbor.

To configure a private registry, do the following:

1. Click **Container Registry Configuration**.
1. Enter the **Registry Server URL**.
1. Enter the **Registry Username**.
1. Enter the **Registry Password**.

### <a id="errands"></a>Errands

The pre-delete errand `deregistar` removes the pre-provisioned Kubernetes service from the Marketplace
and deletes all associated service instances and bindings.
This errand is disabled by default.

### <a id="resource"></a>Resource Config

In the beta phase, Kubernetes Service Manager should be deployed with only the default single instance.

### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Apply All Changes

To deploy Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF and apply your configurations, do the following:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. If you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click Review Pending Changes.
   For more information about this Ops Manager page,
   see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.
